# The Potential of AI to Substitute Traditional University Teaching

This repository contains the final research report for our project exploring whether AI can effectively substitute traditional university teaching. We compared AI-generated lectures (using tools like ChatGPT-4o, DeepSeek, Perplexity, and Le Chat) to in-person professor-led lectures, evaluating factors such as content clarity, scope, diagrams, and assessment questions.
